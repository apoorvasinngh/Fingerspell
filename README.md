# Fingerspell
FingerSpell is a communication tool made by us that can be used when sign language is not an option.

In situations where communication barriers exist due to a lack of knowledge of sign language, FingerSpell utilizes artificial intelligence to detect hand signs and gestures, facilitating clear and easy communication between individuals. 
This innovative approach can help to bridge the communication gap between those who are familiar with sign language and those who are not, promoting better understanding and inclusivity.
